% Notes on Gaussian fitting:
%    Tried a bunch of variations on Gaussian fitting to speed up the
%    results of background subtraction.  Fastest results (by about a factor
%    2) were obtained using lsqcurvefit.  A disadvantage of this technique
%    is that there is no built in facility for using weights.  I tried
%    emplying weights as an additional parameter to lsqcurvefit (additional
%    parameters beyond options are passed directly to the objective
%    function), but this slowed the function by almost a factor of 10.
%    (from 0.065 to 0.4 seconds for a particular test).  Note that using
%    user-supplied jacobians made very little difference in the time
%    (perhaps 5-10%)
%
%    Addendum 1: The factor of 10 turned out to be due to an increase in the
%    number of iterations for the fit to converge. This, in turn, was due
%    to the fact that parameter estimation doesn't work very well when the
%    model most return the model * the weights...
%
%    The best alternative to lsqcurvefit is fit, which does have a weights
%    option. However this was about a factor two slower (0.11-0.14 sec)
%    than the average time for lsqcurvefit.  On the other hand, for the
%    second part of background subtraction routine -- for which the center
%    and fwhm are fixed, we can use 'fit' to create a linear model in the
%    exponential term.  This is much faster than nonlinear fitting, and has
%    been implemented (with weights) below.
%
%    I am now using the curve fitting toolbox for both fits, as the best
%    compromise, since it is fairly fast and handles weights
%    properly and simply.
%
%    Next step would be to implement background subtraction for the area
%    plots.
%
%    Addendum 2: compiled version failed when using gaussbk and gauss
%    within the fittype definition for fitting (depth profiles).  They
%    could most likely be used if these two functions were compiled
%    separately, for example into a library.  As the quicker solution I
%    have simply written out the two functions explicitly.
